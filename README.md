# Scraper
Let's try scraping sports websites. Any sports website. Maybe ESPN. Maybe Fox Sports. Maybe NBA.com. Maybe SB Nation. Or I could scrap all that and scrape something easy.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! And Welcome to the AP Sports Scraper!

In this full-stack application, you can grab the latest sports articles, save them for yourself, and comment on them, all from the Associated Press Sports website!

Simply go to my main page, and type in "/scrape" into the address bar to get the latest stories. From there, you can hit the "Save" Button to hold it in the "Saved" page. Hit the "Comment" button to open up the comments modal and say whatever you want about it -- hit "Save" in the modal to hold on to that comment for future viewing.

Or, if you don't want to have an article saved, simply hit the "Delete" button from the saved page to throw it away.

Have fun, and Happy Sports Scraping!

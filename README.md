# Scraper
Let's try scraping sports websites. Any sports website. Maybe ESPN. Maybe Fox Sports. Maybe NBA.com. Maybe SB Nation. Or I could scrap all that and scrape something easy.
----------------------------------------------------------------
I tried. I really did. But I'm gonna have to tap out on this one too. At least for now.

I know this app won't work, because I don't have this hooked up to Handlebars, and I barely have the Mongoose set up. It's not going to render, as a result.

I know I have to turn something in. But I will have this finished, eventually.
